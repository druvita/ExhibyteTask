Use of README.md file
-README (as the name suggests: “read me”) is the first file one should read when starting a new project. It’s a set of useful information about a project and a kind of manual. It is the first file Github or any Git hosting site will show when someone opens your repository..
-And the.mdextension comes from a word: markdown. It's a markup language for text formatting. Just like HTML it is a markup language to make our documents presentable.
