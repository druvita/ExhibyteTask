# Use of README.md File
-README (as the name suggests: “read me”) is the first file one should read when starting a new project. It’s a set of useful information about a project and a kind of manual. It is the first file Github or any Git hosting site will show when someone opens your repository..
-And the.mdextension comes from a word: markdown. It's a markup language for text formatting. Just like HTML it is a markup language to make our documents presentable.

# Use of gitignore File
A local .gitignore file is usually placed in the root directory of a project. You can also create a global .gitignore file and any entries in that file will be ignored in all of your Git repositories.

To create a local .gitignore file, create a text file and name it .gitignore (remember to include the . at the beginning). Then edit this file as needed. Each new line should list an additional file or folder that you want Git to ignore.

The entries in this file can also follow a matching pattern.

* is used as a wildcard match
/ is used to ignore pathnames relative to the .gitignore file
